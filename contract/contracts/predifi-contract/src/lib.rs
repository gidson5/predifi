// Note: roles 2 (Moderator) and 4 (User) are defined in the access-control

// Role 2 (Moderator) is RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE — it is intended for dispute
// resolution functionality. See issue #595 for the implementation plan.
//
// HOW ROLES ARE ASSIGNED
// ──────────────────────
// 1. Deploy the `access-control` contract and call `access_control::init(admin)`
//    to set the initial administrator.
// 2. The admin calls `access_control::assign_role(admin, user, Role::Operator)`
//    (or `Role::Oracle`, etc.) to grant a role to any address.
// 3. Roles can be revoked with `access_control::revoke_role`, transferred with
//    `access_control::transfer_role`, or bulk-cleared with `revoke_all_roles`.
// 4. Admin authority itself can be transferred via `access_control::transfer_admin`.
// 5. Pass the deployed access-control contract address to
//    `predifi_contract::init(access_control, treasury, fee_bps, resolution_delay)`
//    so the predifi contract knows which access-control instance to query.
